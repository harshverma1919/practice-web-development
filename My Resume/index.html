    <ul>
        <li>During my one-year tenure, I had the opportunity to work on
            a Human Resource Management (HRM) project using the
            Express.js framework in Node.js. This project aimed to
            streamline HR processes, automate tasks, and provide a
            user-friendly interface for HR professionals and employees. </li>
        <li>API Development: I developed RESTful APIs using Express.js
            to handle various HR-related tasks such as employee
            onboarding, leave management, attendance tracking, and
            performance evaluations. These APIs were designed to be
            scalable and efficient, ensuring quick response times even
            with a large number of concurrent users.</li>
        <li>Database Integration: I integrated a suitable database
            system (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) to store and
            manage HR data. I created database schemas, wrote
            efficient queries, and ensured data consistency and
            integrity. </li>
        <li>User Authentication and Authorization: Security was a top
            priority. I implemented user authentication and
            authorization mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to
            protect sensitive HR data. Only authorized users had access
            to specific features and data. </li>
        <li>Front-End Integration: Collaborating with front-end
            developers, I integrated the Express.js backend with the
            front-end components to create a seamless and interactive
            user experience. This involved handling API requests and
            responses, as well as resolving any cross-origin issues.
